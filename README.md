# README
This is a Rails 6 application with a GraphQL API and a React.js front-end.
You will find the React Project folder labeled "contact-app" inside the main/root folder.


This is incomplete with regards to the Front end, but the backend is pretty much 
done and can be queried using the Graphiql interface.
